# Bi-objective-vehicle-routing-integrating-k-shortest-paths:
This work is an extention for our previous work in the paper named "Predicting unsafe driving risk among commercial truck drivers using machine learning: Lessons learned from the surveillance of 20 million driving miles". [This is the code for machine learning methods can be found by the code for machine learing methods](https://mehdizadeamir.github.io/sce_predictions#3_predictive_modeling), created by Amir Mehdizade. Gernarlly speaking, we use the R for machine learning methods. Once the machine learning techniques are complete, we will produce risk indications and input them into the bi-objective ksp problem to assist the driver in selecting the best route while simultaneously taking into account travel time and risk.
This project includes three files.
